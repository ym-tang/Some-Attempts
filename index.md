### I’m still searching for suitable open problems to handle on, and don’t have any original work yet. Here’re two of mine unsuccessful and naive attempts.

- Lehner has a famous conjecture predicting that the coefficients of Ramanujan’s tao function never vanish. I used to wonder if we can use congruence between tao function and elliptic curves to get 
information on those coefficients. For example, if that elliptic curve has a rational p-torsion point, then p divides the number of points of this curve over finite fields at good reduction places. But laterly I found the theorem of Katz (or maybe Serre) saying that the weights of two congruence modular forms also satisfy certain congruent condition. Combined with the fact that each rational elliptic curves is congruent to a weight 2 modular form, it turns out that the tao function can only possibly be congruent to a rational elliptic curve mod 2 or 3 or 11, which can not give us enough information about its coefficients.  


- Another one is whether we can generalize Mazur’s theorem a little bit to results like “there is no elliptic curve with p-torsion over the p-th cyclotomic field for every p larger than some integer”. In some sense, it was supported by Ribet’s result that torsion points of an elliptic curve over the maximal abelian extension of Q are finite. But laterly I found it is covered by Merel’s generalization of Mazur’s work, which is very elegant and original.
